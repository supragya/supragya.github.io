Distributed systems (with adverserial actors) and verifiable compute piques my interest. I love being quite close to hardware!

These days, I've been coding, mostly in ü¶Ä Rust, and practicing some abstract math ‚úé·ù∞. on the side.

Please see my [writings](/posts) or select one of the tags on the right.
