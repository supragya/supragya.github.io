Go-ethereum, by itself is quite interesting. One cannot fathom different things it allows you to do.

```python
def mythingies():
    mythingies = 2*7
    for r in ranges:
        print("There have been many instances of ")
    return mythingies
```

```cpp
for(i = 0; i<200; i++) {
    cout << "there" << endl;
}
```
