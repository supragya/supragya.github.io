Go-ethereum, by itself is quite interesting. One cannot fathom different things it allows you to do.

```python
def mythingies():
    mythingies = 2*7
    for r in ranges:
        print("There have been many instances of ")
    return mythingies
```
```cpp
for(i = 0; i<200; i++) {
    cout << "there" << endl;
}
```
So anyways:
$$
f(x) = \alpha \times \beta
$$
